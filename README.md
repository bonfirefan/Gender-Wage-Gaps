This R Markdown file was the final product for the Heinz College course R for Analytics, completed in Fall 2019. Here, I use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to investigate the research question: is there a significant difference in income between men and women? This file contains the following components:

1. Data cleaning
2. Bivariate analysis of income based and gender
3. Analysis of other demographic characteristics such as race and teenage poverty and their relationship to both income and the gender-income gap
3. A linear regression, accompanied by sensitivity tests
4. Diagnostic plots
5. A discussion
