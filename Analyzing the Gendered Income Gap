**Overview**: This is the final project for the Carnegie Mellon course, R for Analytics and investigates the wage gap between men and women. The assignment required producing plots along and writing a linear regression and interpreting it.     
This file contains the following components:  
1. Data cleaning  
2. Bivariate analysis of income based and gender  
3. Analysis of other demographic characteristics such as race and teenage poverty and their relationship to both income 4. and the gender-income gap  
4. A linear regression, accompanied by sensitivity tests  
5. Diagnostic plots  
6. A discussion

**Full research prompt**: Is there a significant difference in income between men and women? Does the difference vary depending on other factors (e.g., education, marital status, criminal history, drug use, childhood household factors, profession, etc.)?

**Hypothesis and process**: I expect to see income differences by gender, and I also expect income to differ based on race, teenage poverty, marital status, and education levels. 

**Summary of results**: Although the data were not suited to a linear regression, the plots below show compelling evidence of a wage gap between men and women. The plots also show that this gap covaries with demographic characteristics such as race, education, and marital status.

#### **Part 1: Import and Clean the Data**
The data were read from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979 cohort's 2012 dataset, which included over 30 years of follow-up data on a cohort of people who were teenagers in 1979. Although this dataset included many attributes for each respondent, only the most theoretically relevant demographic characteristics were used in this analysis: income, gender, race, teenage poverty, education, marital status, and urban/rural living situation.

When cleaning the data, each factor was coded to show the  most privileged and/or most common category first. For example, gender was coded with men as the default category. For race, "Other" is coded first since that includes white people. The exception to this is for education, where the lowest level was coded as the baseline. Full information about data cleaning is shown in the appendix.

#Create a version of the survey dataset that only drops observations missing income in 2012
survey.2012 <- nlsy %>%
  filter(income >=0)

```

#### **Part 2: Explore Gender and Income Data**

**Distribution of Gender**: As expected, the data contain a roughly equal proportion of men and women -- both in the full dataset and the subset that includes people who reported income in 2012. A univariate plot showing the counts of women and men among 2012 respondents is below.

```{r}
#Define color palette for gender
gender.palette <- scale_fill_manual(values = c("royalblue1", "red3"))

#Plot the univariate distribution of gender for just people with 2012 income data (including top-coded values)
plot.gender <- ggplot(data = survey.2012, aes(x=gender, fill = gender))
uni.gender  <- plot.gender + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  ggtitle("2012 Income respondents\nN = 7,024")+
  gender.palette + 
  ylab("Count of Respondents")

#View plot
uni.gender
```

Note: while unlikely to bias the analysis, women responded slightly more frequently than men in 2012 (`r round(100*nrow(survey.2012[survey.2012$gender=="Female",])/nrow(nlsy[nlsy$gender=="Female",]), 0)`% and `r round(100*nrow(survey.2012[survey.2012$gender=="Male",])/nrow(nlsy[nlsy$gender=="Male",]), 0)`% respectively). There were no respondents with missing or non-binary values for gender.
 
**2012 Income**: The 2012 income distribution by gender is shown below. Notably,  women are concentrated at zero income and under $50,000 in annual earnings. Men have a higher density than women between $50,000 and $200,000. Men are also over-represented at the very highest end of the distribution on the right side of the plot. Both genders have first modes at zero and second modes under $100,000, though men's second mode is higher than that of women.

```{r}
#Create a gender density plot
gender.dense1 <-  ggplot(data = survey.2012, aes(x = income)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = gender), alpha = 0.5) +
  ggtitle("Income Density Plot by Gender\nAll 2012 Respondents")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, vjust = 1, hjust = 1)) + gender.palette + 
  xlab("2012 Income ($)")

gender.dense1

#Create summary table of top 2 pct to reference in text chunk below.
top2pct <- survey.2012 %>%
  filter(income == max(survey.2012$income)) %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
```

A limitation of NLSY dataset is that the income distribution is top-coded. That is, the income values for the top two percent of earners have been over-written with the mean value for that group -- `r max(nlsy$income, na.rm = T)` dollars. This is shown in the bump on the far right side of the density plot above. With `r top2pct[1, 2]` men and `r top2pct[2, 2]` women in the top two percent, measures of "average income by gender" are less accurate than they would be if the dataset contained raw values. 

In order to understand the top two percent in the context of this analysis, the plots below show the full income distribution and the percentages of women across the income distribution, mapped by *percentile*. In the first plot, it is noticeable that the bottom quarter of the sample had no income in 2012, and there is a large jump in income from the 97th to 98th percentile, reflecting the top-coding. In the second plot, it is noticeable that beyond approximately the 80th income percentile, the percentage of women drops off sharply. Within the top two percent, there are only `r round(top2pct[2, 2]*100/(top2pct[1, 2] + top2pct[2, 2]), 0)`% women.

```{r}
#Plot by percentiles to view top coding
#Note: Using 50 ntiles here and multiplying by 2 to make the line slightly cleaner -- this works in favor of showing the top 2 percent as clearly as possible without distraction.
pctgender <- survey.2012 %>%
  group_by(ntile = 2*ntile(income, 50)) %>%
  summarize(pct_women  = sum(gender == "Female")*100/n(),
            avg_income = mean(income))

pctgender.plot2 <- ggplot(pctgender, aes(x = ntile, y = avg_income))
pctgender.plot2 + geom_bar(stat =  "identity") +
  xlab("Income percentile (including top-coded 2%)") +
  ylab("Average income ($)") +
  ggtitle("Average Income by Percentile")

pctgender.plot1 <- ggplot(pctgender, aes(x = ntile, y=pct_women))
pctgender.plot1 + geom_line(color = "red3")+
  xlab("Income percentile (including top-coded 2%)") + 
  ylab("Percent women")+ 
  ylim(0,100)+
  coord_equal() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 50)+
  ggtitle("Percent Women by Income Percentile")

```

**Dropping the top 2%:** All analyses below will focus on the bottom 98% of earners unless otherwise noted. This choice was made for two reasons:   
1) This limits to only valid income data.  
2) Focusing on the bottom 98% of earners is still a meaningful target population.  

**Bivariate Analysis of Gender and Income:**
The plot below compares average 2012 income by gender. Since the top two percent of earners (disproportionately men) are excluded, this difference is likely downward-biased. That is, the true difference in mean income between men and women is likely larger than the wage gap shown here.

As shown below, there is a substantial difference in average 2012 income by gender. However, when just looking at a bivariate analysis, it is impossible to know whether this difference is due to a confounding demographic variable -- such as education or having children. Although it is not possible to assess every possible confounding factor due to data limitations (eg. the children variable is incomplete because it was only asked of women) and immeasurable attributes (eg. motivation) and causal inference is outside of the scope of this project, exploring additional demographic variables can help us understand whether the earnings difference between men and women can be easily "explained away" by other factors. In preparation for running a regression that takes into account demographic covariates, other demographic variables are examined below. These graphs are in purple to show that they include both men and women. 

```{r}


#Plot for bottom 98% (using dataset survey.notopcode)
gap.gender <- survey.notopcode %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarize(AvgIncome  = mean(income),
            upper = t.test(income)$conf.int[1],
            lower = t.test(income)$conf.int[2])

# Plot, with error bars
gap.gender.plot <- ggplot(data = gap.gender, aes(x = gender, y = AvgIncome, fill = gender))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Gender") + 
  ylab("Average Income($)") +
  ggtitle("Income Gap\nBivariate Analysis of the Target Population: the Bottom 98%") + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = upper, ymin = lower), width = 0.1, size = 1) +
  theme(text = element_text(size=12)) +
  gender.palette
gap.gender.plot

#Summarize the people with zero income by gender.
no.income <- survey.2012 %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarize(PctNoIncome = round(100*sum(income==0)/n(), 0), TotalCount = n())

#This code has been commented out because it distracts from the main argument. However, it is available for future analyses.
#Re-plot for only people in the bottom 98% with earnings > 0 
# gap.gender.nonzero <- survey.notopcode %>%
#   group_by(gender) %>%
#   filter(income != 0) %>%
#   summarize(AvgIncome  = mean(income),
#             upper = t.test(income)$conf.int[1],
#             lower = t.test(income)$conf.int[2])
# 
# # Plot, with error bars
# gap.gender.plot.nonzero <- ggplot(data = gap.gender.nonzero, aes(x = gender, y = AvgIncome,
#                             fill = gender)) +
#   geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
#   xlab("Gender") + 
#   ylab("Average Income($)") +
#   ggtitle("Income Gap \nSubset to Nonzero Income") + 
#   guides(fill = FALSE) +
#   geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = upper, ymin = lower), width = 0.1, size = 1) +
#   theme(text = element_text(size=12)) +
#   gender.palette + ylim(0, 60000)
# 


```


Note: expanding on the bar charts above, additional checks were run that showed that `r no.income[1,2]`% of the `r no.income[1,3]` men had zero income, while `r no.income[2,2]`% of the `r no.income[2,3]` women had zero income. That said, a sensitivity check removing respondents with no earnings from the sample did not make the wage gap disappear. Therefore, these respondents *will* be included in all further analyses because they represent an important part of the NLSY universe. 

#### **Part 3: View Plots for Potential Covariates**

Each demographic variable below will be examined in three ways:

1) A **univariate analysis** will show the frequency of respondents (ex. how many people experienced teen poverty). The y axis for this type of plot will show the number of respondents fitting into a given category.

2) A **bivariate analysis** will show how income varies across categories (ex. what is the average income for people who experienced teen poverty?). The y axis will show income levels.

3) A **wage gap analysis**  will show how the *difference in income between men and women* varies across categories (ex. what is the wage gap for people who experienced teen poverty?). The y axis will show average income differences.

**Covariate 1: Race**
There are three race categories in this dataset: "Black", "Hispanic", and "Other". This categorization is inherently limited for a few reasons:   
1) It groups asian, Native American, mixed race, and white people   
2) Respondents who are black and hispanic must be categorized as one or the other and   
3) In the original data collection, respondents were also classified by the surveyor’s perception. That said, even a variable with limitations can show important trends. The count of people in each racial group in target population is shown below. Approximately half of the respondents were in the "other" category, followed by black respondents. The smallest group was hispanic respondents. 

```{r}
#Create univariate plot for race
raceuni <- ggplot(survey.notopcode, aes(x=race, fill = I("mediumpurple")))
raceuni + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  ggtitle("Univariate Racial Breakdown") + 
  ylab("Number of Respondents") + 
  xlab("Race")
```

Below, the bivariate and wage gap analyses show income information for each racial group. The table on the left below shows the association between race and income. As shown by the error bars that are far from overlapping, there were substantial differences in average wages by racial group. The plot on the right shows differences in pay gaps by race. demonstrating that although people in the "other" category earn an average of $40,000, men and women within this group receive vastly different average wages -- with an average wage gap of approximately $20,000. Black respondents earned the least money overall and also had the smallest wealth gap, with a difference between men's and women's earnings of  approximately $5,000.


```{r}
race.bi.conf <- survey.notopcode %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  summarize(AvgIncome = mean(income),
            upper = t.test(income)$conf.int[1],
            lower = t.test(income)$conf.int[2])

race.bi <- ggplot(data = race.bi.conf, aes(x = race, y = AvgIncome, fill = I("mediumpurple"))) +

  theme(text = element_text(size=12), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))

# Calculate income gaps (male - female) and 95% confidence intervals
# for the gap
racegap <- survey.notopcode %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  summarize(income.gap = mean(income[gender == "Male"], na.rm = TRUE) -
              mean(income[gender == "Female"], na.rm = TRUE),
            upper = t.test(income ~ gender)$conf.int[1],
            lower = t.test(income ~ gender)$conf.int[2])


# Plot, with error bars
racegapplot <- ggplot(data = racegap, aes(x = race, y = income.gap, fill = I("mediumpurple"))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("race") + 
  ylab("Income gap($)") +
  ggtitle("Gender Analysis\nIncome Gap by Race") + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = upper, ymin = lower), width = 0.1, size = 1) +
  xlab("Race") + 
  ylab("Average Gap in Income ($)") +
  theme(text = element_text(size=12), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))+
  ylim(-10000, 50000)   

#Arrange side-by-side so that the average and associated gaps are clear.
grid.arrange(race.bi +  ylim(-10000, 50000), racegapplot, ncol = 2)
```

**Covariate 2: teenage poverty**:  
This binary variable measuring family poverty in 1979 is a blunt measure of childhood socioeconomic status, which is likely to affect adult earnings. Approximately 2,500 respondents did not answer this question (coded in the raw data as "invalid skip"). Given that a lack of response may indicate something about family dynamics, these values have been coded as "Unknown" rather than NA and are colored in grey to be easily differentiable from response values in purple.

The univariate breakdown of teenage poverty below shows that most teens in the sample were not in poverty. However, the number of respondents whose families reported meeting the poverty criteria was equal to those whose status was unknown.



```{r}
childpoverty.palette <- scale_fill_manual(values = c("mediumpurple", "mediumpurple", "#c1cdcd"))
childpovertyuni <- ggplot(survey.notopcode, aes(x=childpoverty, fill = childpoverty))
childpovertyuni + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  ggtitle("Univariate Teenage Poverty Breakdown") + 
  childpoverty.palette + 
  guides(fill = F) + 
  xlab("Teenage poverty") + 
  ylab("Count of Respondents")
```

As expected, respondents who experienced teenage poverty earned lower average wages as adults than those who were not in poverty.

There were also noticeable wage gaps by gender across poverty lines. Specifically, there was a larger difference in average wages for those who did **not** grow up in poverty than those who experienced teenage poverty (with gaps of appoximately $15,000 and $7,500 respectively).


```{r}
childpoverty.bi.conf <- survey.notopcode %>%
  group_by(childpoverty) %>%
  summarize(AvgIncome = mean(income),
            upper = t.test(income)$conf.int[1],
            lower = t.test(income)$conf.int[2])

childpoverty.bi <- ggplot(data = childpoverty.bi.conf, aes(x = childpoverty, y = AvgIncome, fill = childpoverty)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Teenage Poverty ") + 
  ylab("Average Income ($)") +

**Covariate 3: Marital Status**  
One might expect that married women would earn less money than unmarried women on average because of the potential for spousal wages in a two-adult household. However, the data show a different story. As with the other demographic characteristics, the exploration of marital status below starts with a univariate analysis. Most respondents were married.

Note: The marital data were last collected in 2000. The "unknown" values (in grey below) have been left in the analysis since dropping people who did not respond to a survey in 2000 could bias the analysis.

```{r}
marital.palette <- scale_fill_manual(values = c("mediumpurple", "mediumpurple", "mediumpurple", "#c1cdcd"))

#Create base plot for marital status
maritaluni <- ggplot(survey.notopcode, aes(x=marital, fill = marital))

#Show univariate analysis of marital status

  ggtitle("Univariate Marital Status Breakdown") + 
  marital.palette + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  xlab("Marital Status in 2000") + 
  ylab("Number of respondents")
```

Moving forward with a bivariate analysis below, the plot on the left shows that married people earned over $10,000 more on average in annual wages than non-married people The plot on the right shows that the income gap between men and women was largest among married respondents at over $20,000. However, among the unmarried respondents, there was no detectable income gap (as shown by the negative bar with a confidence interval that overlaps with zero).

```{r}
marital.bi.conf <- survey.notopcode %>%
  group_by(marital) %>%
  summarize(AvgIncome = mean(income),
            upper = t.test(income)$conf.int[1],

            upper = t.test(income ~ gender)$conf.int[1],
            lower = t.test(income ~ gender)$conf.int[2])

  ylim(-10000, 50000)   

grid.arrange(marital.bi+  ylim(-10000, 50000), maritalgapplot, ncol = 2)
```


Given the odd pattern with married individuals both earning the most and having the largest wage gap in contrast to any other group, an additional box plot was run to view gender differences by marital status. This showed that the results above were driven by married men who earned substantially higher wages than any other group. As shown in the box plot, the difference was extreme; married men earning in the 50th percentile received higher wages than people at the 75th percentile in almost every other group.

```{r}
maritalbox
```

Note: Although spousal wage was included in the dataset, it is excluded from this analysis due to the limitations caused by top-coding of that variable. Although limiting to the bottom 98% of earners in the respondents is easily interpretable, limiting the analysis to only people with spouses in the bottom 98% would lead to convoluted explanations of the target sample.

**Covariate 4: Education:**  
The raw education variable included 20 levels, corresponding to the number of grades the respondent had completed (where 12 is graduating high school, and 16 is graduating with a bachelor's degree on a traditional timeline). There are three ways to approach the education variable:  
1) Using the raw numeric variable, indicating highest grade completed. Plugging this into a regression would result in output showing "for every additional grade completed, income increases by X dollars". This is ideal if we believe the association between education and income is linear.    
2) Using the raw data, but changing it to a factor variable. Plugging this into a regression would show how every grade relates to earnings.     
3) Binning the educational categories into new factors.   

Prior to deciding how to approach the education variable, data exploration was run, as shown below. In the univariate plot, there is a clear mode with almost half the sample ending their educational journey after graduating high school (highest grade = 12).

```{r}
highestgradeuni <- ggplot(survey.notopcode, aes(x=highestgrade, fill = I("mediumpurple")))
highestgradeuni + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  ggtitle("Univariate Breakdown of Respondents' Highest Grade Completed")  + 
  xlab("Highest Grade Completed")
```

As expected, the bivariate analysis of average income by education level showed a pattern of education and income increasing together. The error bars are extremely large for the lowest grades because the sample is so small.

```{r}
gap.data.conf <- survey.notopcode %>%
  group_by(as.factor(highestgrade)) %>%
  summarize(AvgIncome = mean(income),
            upper = t.test(income)$conf.int[1],
            lower = t.test(income)$conf.int[2])

# Plot, with error bars
ggplot(data = gap.data.conf, aes(x = `as.factor(highestgrade)`, y = AvgIncome, fill = I("mediumpurple"))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("as.factor(highestgrade)") +

  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = upper, ymin = lower), width = 0.1, size = 1) +
  theme(text = element_text(size=12)) + xlab("Highest Grade Completed")
```

When the wage/gender gap was assessed by education level (limiting to grades 8 and above), the gap was readily apparent at all levels except the two highest. However, a sensitivity check revealed that this was due to removing the top 2% of earners. After the check was re-run, levels 19 and 20 also showed substantial differences in earnings by gender.
```{r}
educationgap_notopcode <- survey.notopcode[survey.notopcode$highestgrade >=8,] %>%
  group_by(as.factor(highestgrade)) %>%
  summarize(income.gap = mean(income[gender == "Male"], na.rm = TRUE) -
              mean(income[gender == "Female"], na.rm = TRUE),
            upper = t.test(income ~ gender)$conf.int[1],
            lower = t.test(income ~ gender)$conf.int[2],
            is.significant = as.numeric(t.test(income ~ gender)$p.value < 0.05))

              mean(income[gender == "Female"], na.rm = TRUE),
            upper = t.test(income ~ gender)$conf.int[1],
            lower = t.test(income ~ gender)$conf.int[2],
            is.significant = as.numeric(t.test(income ~ gender)$p.value < 0.05))

ggplot(data = educationgap_all, aes(x = `as.factor(highestgrade)`, y = income.gap,fill = I("mediumpurple"))) +

  theme(text = element_text(size=12))  +

```


Following the in-depth look at education above, the variable was binned into five categories, which are shown below. The reasoning behind this was twofold:  
1) Not every grade has clear social meaning that is expected to translate into earnings. For example, an increase from 10th to 11th grade is different from the increase from 15th to 16th grade, as 16th grade generally denotes a bachelor's degree, while an 11th grade student still will not have a high school diploma.   
2) There are very few students at each grade level under high school.   

The new distribution is shown below. 

```{r}
edu.binuni <- ggplot(survey.notopcode, aes(x=edu.bin, fill = I("mediumpurple")))
edu.binuni + geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  ggtitle("Univariate Binned Education Breakdown") + 
  xlab("Binned Education") + 
  ylab("Number of Respondents")
```


The same bivariate analyses as above were also run for this binned education category. Again, every bin showed gendered wage gaps, and the largest wage gap was for those with a bachelor's degree. However, this is likely biased by excluding the top two percent of earners, who are mostly men.

```{r}
edu.bin.bi.conf <- survey.notopcode %>%
  group_by(edu.bin) %>%
  summarize(AvgIncome = mean(income),
            upper = t.test(income)$conf.int[1],

```

**Covariate 5: Urban vs. Rural**  
The univariate plot below shows that most respondents lived in urban areas in 2012. Very few respondents had values of NA. There is not the same type of stigma for this variable as there is for poverty, so it is unlikely that cutting out respondents who failed to answer this question will bias the sample. Therefore, these have been left as "NA" rather than creating an additional level of the factor variable called "Unknown". Using this variable in a regression will result in a slightly smaller sample because respondents with  NA values will be dropped.

```{r}
urban.palette <- scale_fill_manual(values = c("mediumpurple", "mediumpurple", "#009900"))
urbanuni <- ggplot(survey.notopcode, aes(x=urban, fill = urban, color = I("grey")))
urbanuni + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count", na.rm = F) + 
  ggtitle("Univariate Urban vs. Rural Breakdown") + 
  urban.palette + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  xlab("Urban vs. Rural") + 
  ylab("Number of Respondents")
```

Given the often higher cost of living in urban areas, it is surprising that urban and rural respondents had such similar salaries. Additionally, there was no discernable difference in the wage gap across respondents who lived in urban versus rural places in 2012. One explanation for this may be that this binary variable is limited in its ability to capture the true breadth of living environments.

```{r}
urban.bi.conf <- survey.notopcode %>%
  group_by(urban) %>%
  summarize(AvgIncome = mean(income),
            upper = t.test(income)$conf.int[1],

```


**Covariate 6: Industry**  
Looking beyond the demographic covariates above, some might argue that women simply choose lower paying industries. In order to explore this argument, the main regression will be run both with and without the "industry" variable. An exploration of the industry variable is shown below.

This univariate plot shows that the most common industry category for respondents is Health Care & Social Assistance. 

```{r}
industry.bi.conf <- survey.notopcode %>%
  group_by(industry) %>%
  summarize(AvgIncome = mean(income),
            upper = t.test(income)$conf.int[1],
            lower = t.test(income)$conf.int[2], count = n())

industry.bi.conf <- mutate(industry.bi.conf,
                           industry = reorder(industry, count))

industryuni <- ggplot(industry.bi.conf, aes(x=industry, y = count, fill = I("mediumpurple")))
industryuni + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  ggtitle("Univariate Industry Breakdown - Ordered by Count of Respondents") + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  xlab("Industry") + 
  ylab("Number of Respondents")+
  theme(text = element_text(size=12), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))

```

In order to maintain consistency, the plots below are also ordered by frequency of industry. In the first bivariate chart, we see that people in the Information, Finance/Insurance, and Professional/Science/Tech sectors earn the highest wages. People in food services and other parts of the service industry make the lowest wages, as expected. As a matter of data consistency, it is worth noting that some of those coded as "valid skip" had nonzero income, so the interpretation of industry findings is unclear. A full table showing the count of people with zero income per industry is shown in the data cleaning appendix. 

Regarding gender gaps, the largest gaps are in the industries that are also the highest pay gaps: Finance/Insurance, and Professional/Science/Tech. Some industries such as real estate and Entertainment/Recreation have indiscernible wage gaps. Construction also has an undiscernable wage gap.

##### **Part 4: Regression**
After investigating the demographic characteristics above, a linear regression was run to re-assess the gender wage gap while accounting for other demographic characteristics, including race, teenage poverty, marital status, education, and urban/rural living environment. This allowed for isolating the differences by gender while accounting for other factors. The output is shown below. In this regression, industry has been excluded in order to only look at demographic characteristics. As with all analyses above, it is restricted to the bottom 98% of earners.

``` {r}
regression <- lm(income ~ gender + race + marital + edu.bin + childpoverty + urban, data = survey.notopcode)
kable(summary(regression)$coefficients, digits = c(0, 2, 2, 4))

sensitivity.topcode <- lm(income ~ gender + race + marital + edu.bin + childpoverty + urban, data = survey.2012)

sensitivity.industry <- lm(income ~ gender + race + marital + edu.bin + childpoverty + urban + industry, data = survey.notopcode)

sensitivity.interaction <- lm(income ~ gender*race + marital + edu.bin + childpoverty + urban, data = survey.notopcode)
testintersection<-anova(regression, sensitivity.interaction)

```

All outcome coefficients in the model are significant at the p = 0.05 level with the exception of comparing Hispanic and Other-Race respondents. Therefore, we can interpret the following:

**Gender**: Gender is extremely meaningful in predicting wages. Holding race, marital status, education, child poverty, and urban/rural environment constant, women earn an average of `r round(-summary(regression)$coefficients[2,1],0)` dollars less than men. 

**Race**: Holding gender, marital status, education, child poverty, and urban/rural environment constant, Hispanic people earn an average of `r round(-summary(regression)$coefficients[3,1],0)` dollars less than their non-black/non-hispanic counterparts, and Black people earn an average of `r round(-summary(regression)$coefficients[4,1],0)` dollars less than their non-black/non-hispanic counterparts. However, with a p-value of `r summary(regression)$coefficients[3,4]`, we do not have evidence to reject the null hypothesis that Hispanic people earn the same average wages as non-black/non-hispanic (aka "other") people. 

**Marital Status**: Holding gender, race, education, childhood poverty, and urban/rural environment constant, married people earn an average of `r round(-summary(regression)$coefficients[5,1], 0)` dollars more than  people who were unmarried in 2000, `r round(-summary(regression)$coefficients[6,1], 0)` dollars more than people whose marital status was "other" (for example divorced or widowed), and `r round(-summary(regression)$coefficients[7,1], 0)` dollars more than people whose marital status was unknow for the 2000 survey.

**Education**: Education is associated with tremendous gains in income. With a base group of those who have an education level lower than high school, we find that people with the same gender, race, marital status, child poverty, and urban/rural living environment have wages of an average of `r round(summary(regression)$coefficients[8,1], 0)` more dollars per year after receiving a high school diploma. Those with some college earn an average of `r round(summary(regression)$coefficients[9,1],0)` dollars more per year than their counterparts without high school diplomas. However, as expected, the largest gains are for people with bachelor's and graduate degrees, with dollar increases of `r round(summary(regression)$coefficients[10,1],0)` and `r round(summary(regression)$coefficients[11,1],0)` respectively.

**Child poverty**: As expected, people who experienced poverty as teenagers had lower average adult wages than those with the same gender/race/marital/education/living characteristics who did not experience childhood poverty. The average difference in income across these groups was `r round(-summary(regression)$coefficients[12,1],0)` dollars. Those with an unknown poverty status also had an average decrease of `r round(-summary(regression)$coefficients[13,1],0)` dollars, as compared to their counterparts who definitively were not in poverty in the year 1979.

**Urban/Rural Living Environment**: The difference in income based on urban/rural living environment was significant yet small in magnitude. Holding all else constant, people living in a rural environment earned an average of `r round(-summary(regression)$coefficients[14,1],0)` less per year than their urban counterparts. 

**Comparison to Bivariate results of Income/Gender**
Comparing to the t-test that was run at the start of this project without covariates, we see that the gender gap has changed from `r round(gap.gender[1,2]-gap.gender[2,2],0)` without covariates to `r round(-regression$coefficients[2], 0)` after these covariates were accounted for. This means that holding all else constant, women in the sample earned an average of `r round(-regression$coefficients[2], 0)` dollars less than men. Essentially, none of these covariates explained away the wage gap. Rather, accounting for demographic characteristics has $increased$ the size of the gap that can be attributed to gender. 

Beyond this main regression, a few additional sensitivity checks were run:

**1) Top Coding:** The regression above was re-run including the top-coded earners. The results from this check showed that the gender coefficient grew from `r round(-regression$coefficients[2],0)` to `r round(-sensitivity.topcode$coefficients[2],0)`. While it is impossible to gauge without the raw data whether this change of approximately `r round(abs(regression$coefficients[2] - sensitivity.topcode$coefficients[2]),-3)` dollars is an accurate figure, we can infer that the current estimate, which focuses on the bottom 98%, is downward-biased, and the difference in earnings between men and women is quite large.

**2) Including Industry:** When the 18-level variable for industry was included in the model, the gender coefficient changed from `r round(-regression$coefficients[2],0)` to `r round( -sensitivity.industry$coefficients[2],0)`. Therefore, while holding industry constant decreased the wage gap, it still did not eliminate it.

**3) Intersectionality:** There is substantial theory and evidence that women of different races experience gender discrimination differently. A regression accounting for this showed that women from the "Other Race" category earned an average of `r round(-summary(sensitivity.interaction)$coefficients[2,1])` less than men with identical characteristics. In contrast, women from the Hispanic category earned an average of `r round(-summary(sensitivity.interaction)$coefficients[2,1]) + round(summary(sensitivity.interaction)$coefficients[3,1])` less than men with identical characteristics, and women from the black category earned an average of `r round(-summary(sensitivity.interaction)$coefficients[2,1]) + round(summary(sensitivity.interaction)$coefficients[4,1])` less than men with identical characteristics. An ANOVA assessing the significance of the interaction term showed a p-value of less than 0.001. Essentially, adding race as a covariate changed the relationship between gender and income. This is in line with the bar charts in the "race" covariate section above. 

The new regression is displayed in full below. As expected when changing the regression model in any way, values for all covariates have changed. However, all the trends for marital status, education, child poverty, and urban/rural location have stayed constant. One other notable difference between the two models is in the P-values. The coefficient for Hispanic is now significant, and unknown child poverty status now has a p-value just above 0.05, so it is technically not significant. That said, the Hispanic coefficient is now specific to Hispanic men when interpreted in isolation. Additionally, these changes to P-values (along with the small changes in coefficient estimates) do not change the overall takeaways of the regression. Therefore, the only important parts of this output to pay attention to are the gender and race coefficients (in addition to the interaction terms such as "genderFemale:raceHispanic").

#### **Part 5: Plot diagnostics**
The plots below show that a linear regression was $not$ the correct model for these data. 

In the plot of residuals versus fitted values, we see that the absolute value of residuals gets further away from the 0 mark as the fitted values increase. Additionally, there is a hard black line sloping downwards on that plot showing that the residuals are stopping at different points (likely because income cannot be negative). This is not what we expect. When a linear model is correct, residuals should have constant variance, and the residuals and fitted values should be uncorrelated.


Additionally, the Q-Q plot shows that these data were not normal. This makes sense, given the shape of the income distribution shown in the initial density plot. Based on the non-normal data, we can still use a linear model for prediction, but the p-values from the regression are not believable. This invalidates the analysis above explaining that all values except the comparison of Hispanic and Other race were significant and therefore were unlikely to have happened by chance.

For the scale-location plot, there should be no discernable trends. In the plot below, we see a black line sloping upwards.

Finally, for the residuals versus leverage plot, we fortunately do not see any values outside of Cook's Distance, and the red line showing the pattern is fortunately flat. 

Note: All sensitivity regressions mentioned above also failed to pass the checks provided by these plots.

These plots essentially indicate that although the regression above can be interpreted as a model to predict income, no estimates of statistical significance are valid.

#### **Part 6: Discussion**
**Main findings:** This analysis shows that there is a substantial gap in average income for men and women, and it does not disappear when other demographic or industry factors are accounted for. Additionally, we see in this analysis that black people on average earn lower wages than other non-hispanic groups. We also see that education is positively associated with earnings, as expected. Marital status is positively associated with earnings (which is driven by the high earnings of married men), and living in rural areas and growing up in poverty are negatively associated with earnings.

**Limitations:** The strength of this analysis is that contains both childhood and adult demographic factors for thousands of people. However, there are also many limitations:  
1) There may be bias induced by missing income data. This includes people who didn't respond and the top two percent of earners whose values were overwritten. Even seeking to generalize to others in the 98% of people with lowest income (our target population) may be imperfect.  
2) These demographic variables cannot capture the full human experience. Gender is not truly a binary, and race cannot be categorized into three neat categories.  
3) The number of variables included in this analysis is limited.  
4) The actual income distribution is not normal, and a linear regression is not the correct model for this analysis.  
5) The dataset is limited to people who were teenagers in 1979 and successfully recruited for this analysis.  
Finally, it is important to note that this analysis makes no claims of allowing for $causal$ inference. 

**Level of confidence:**
Based on the plotting statistics, I am not confident in the results of this regression. The P-values reported here cannot be understood to be meaningful because the base assumptions for a linear regression were not met. However, although this product did not produce a valid linear regression, the plots created above are still valid characterizations of the data. There is compelling evidence of a wage gap between men and women, and this gap covaries with demographic characteristics such as race, education, and marital status.

**Next steps:** Future analyses could investigate the following:  
1)**Log income**: Given the skewed distribution of income, replacing the independent variable with ln(income) could produce better regression results. However, given that ln(0) is undefined and approximately a quarter of the sample has zero income, this would fundamentally alter the analysis. Additionally, preliminary analyses of ln(income) also did not show a normal distribution.  
2)**Literature review**: The covariates chosen for this analysis were based on the author's opinions. However, a superior analysis would choose covariates based on a literature review.

**Urban**: This check shows how the urban/rural variable was coded with urban as the default
```{r}
kable(urbancleaning)
